Future Enhancements (Possible/Planned)
-----------------------------
* Possible integration with ModMon NVRAM checker (JGrana)
* add a success event for when the script starts up, and perhaps check the amount of uptime of the router, and if it's less 
  than 5 minutes, send a notification that the router just rebooted
* check for certain events like wan down that might require forcing a router reboot

To-Do:
-----
* AMTM Email notifications on certain events (like 80% disk usage)

Completed:
----------
* opkg install column -- RTRMON!
* FIX the VPN-site-to-site option and exclude any private VPNs from needing ping tests or city lookups. (visortgw)
* 'update [y/n] not waiting for an enter keypress causing the Enter to go into the buffer and skipping the next prompt'
* Sorting of attached clients, name/ip/mac, etc.
* Find way to exclude VPN from Connection test due to private site-to-site private IPs causing delays (visortgw)
* Implement -now switch
* Instead of just showing up-to-2 VPN connections, show all of them
* Startup on a certain page (Stephen Harrington)
* Go direct to pages 1-5 (Stephen Harrington)
* Implement the exec command to apply changes immediately per @thelonelycoder
* Speedtest VPN connection in addition to WAN
* Snapshot of top bandwidth usage on br0 and eth* and vpn*
* Allow user to pick own custom speedtest server by ID
* maybe an option to disable the countdown bar? i find it distracting (@ugandy)
* config changes are applied upon exit & save
* Autorotate through pages (Stephen Harrington)
* Added CPU IRQ stats to the CPU stats
* Show VPN traffic usage on WAN/LAN page
* Add log events for boot, speedtest and vpn api calls
* Force update (like in vpnmon-r2)
* Add UDP open ports tab
* WAN diagnostics/test page
* Allow percentage results to indicate > 100%
* Added compatiblity for the GT-AXE/AX line of routers
